About Me -
I have a passion for watching football and cricket, which I find both exciting and engaging. In my free time, I also love playing video games as a way to unwind and challenge myself.
Spending quality time with friends and family is incredibly important to me, and I cherish these moments. Additionally, I have a soft spot for street dogs and puppies,
and I thoroughly enjoy playing with them whenever I get the chance.
